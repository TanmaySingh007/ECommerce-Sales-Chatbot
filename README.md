# ECommerce-Sales-Chatbot
A full-stack AI-powered Sales Chatbot designed as a case study to demonstrate the development of an intelligent conversational assistant for e-commerce platforms. This project showcases a complete pipeline — from intuitive frontend UI to a Python-based backend server with a mock inventory — built to simulate a real-world.
📌 Case Study Overview
In the competitive domain of online retail, effective customer engagement is key. This project aims to develop an interactive chatbot that enhances the online shopping journey — from product discovery to purchase — using a modern tech stack and conversational interface.

The chatbot is tailored for an e-commerce platform specializing in a specific product category (e.g., books, electronics, or clothing), enabling smooth interaction, real-time responses, and data-driven suggestions.

🎯 Objectives
Build a conversational chatbot interface for product search, filtering, and purchasing

Simulate backend logic to handle user queries via REST APIs

Create and manage a mock inventory using a relational database

Store session data for interaction history and analytics

Deliver clean, modular, and well-documented Python code

🧩 Key Features
💬 Chatbot Interface
Responsive UI (mobile, tablet, desktop compatible)

Clean chat interface with reset functionality and timestamps

Real-time interaction with backend services

Persistent session tracking for better continuity

🔐 User Management
Login/Signup flow with session-based authentication

Secure chat sessions linked to user identity

📦 Inventory & Backend
Python-based RESTful API (Flask)

Mock e-commerce inventory with 100+ products

Product search, filter, and detail retrieval

Structured error handling and logging

🗂️ Data Handling
